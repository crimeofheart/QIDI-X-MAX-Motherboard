STM32F4 micro-controllers (SKR Pro 1.1)
===============================================
STM32F4 microcontrollers come equipped with a built-in system bootloader
capable of flashing over USB (via DFU), 3.3v Serial, and various other
methods (see STM Document AN2606 for more information).  Some
STM32F4 boards, such as the SKR Pro 1.1, are not able to enter the DFU
bootloader.  The HID bootloader is available for STM32F405/407
based boards should the user prefer flashing over USB over using the sdcard.
Note that you may need to configure and build a version specific to your
board, a [build for the SKR Pro 1.1 is available here](
  https://github.com/Arksine/STM32_HID_Bootloader/releases/tag/v0.5-beta).

Unless your board is DFU capable the most accessable flashing method
is likely via 3.3v serial, which follows the same procedure as [flashing the
STM32F103 using stm32flash](#stm32f103-micro-controllers-blue-pill-devices).
For example:
```
wget https://github.com/Arksine/STM32_HID_Bootloader/releases/download/v0.5-beta/hid_bootloader_SKR_PRO.bin

stm32flash -w hid_bootloader_SKR_PRO.bin -v -g 0 /dev/ttyAMA0
```

This bootloader requires 16Kib of flash space on the STM32F4 (the application
must be compiled with a start address of 16KiB).

As with the STM32F1, the STM32F4 uses the hid-flash tool to upload binaries to
the MCU. See the instructions above for details on how to build and use
hid-flash.

It may be necessary to manually enter the bootloader, this can be done by
setting "boot 0" low, "boot 1" high and plugging in the device.  After
programming is complete unplug the device and set "boot 1" back to low
so the application will be loaded.
